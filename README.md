# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains my bachelor's thesis and the associated source code in the attached jupyter notebook. Furthermore, I included implementations of neural networks written in PyTorch that ended up being unused in the thesis.  For reasons of plagiarism, I set the repository to private. Feel free to contact me and request access!
