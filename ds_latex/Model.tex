\chapter{Problem formulation}

This chapter gives a short overview of the RMDPEAT introduced in \cite{Hildebrandt2020_EAT}. The RMDPEAT combines the dynamic pick-up and delivery problem presented in \cite{UlmerRMDP} with arrival time estimation and hence accounts for both processes. The integration of these fields is important since it opens up the possibility for customers to choose a preferred restaurant or none at all based on estimated arrival times. We will use the route based markov decision process model notation.
