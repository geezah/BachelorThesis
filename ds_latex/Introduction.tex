%%% Motiviere Problem
Nobody likes waiting for food when they are hungry - or waiting at all. In fact, when doing research on this topic, psychologists found out that increased waiting times generally have a significant negative impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty (\citealt{WaitingTime1}, \citealt{WaitingTime2}). The online food delivery market is in high demand as more than 700 million people globally used food delivery services in 2017. Twice as many users are expected in 2024 \citep{Statista1}. In the US, the biggest platform-to-delivery companies like GrubHub, Domino's Pizza and UberEATS have close market shares. Thus, waiting not only becomes a large scaled economic issue due to the already very big user base. The provider side, whether it be the numerous restaurants or the meal delivery platforms, operate in highly competitive environments. However, one might not expect that the customers’ own perceptions regarding their waiting time negatively affect the perceived service quality stronger than actual waiting times do [5,6]. Given these points, we can conclude that a key challenge and chance lies in the communication of accurate arrival time estimations to customers.

A popular and common way to tackle prediction tasks in general is the use of machine learning techniques. In the last years, it has proven to be a powerful forecasting tool in a wide variety of setting. For arrival time estimation, a go-to choice seems to be the use of supervised learning: Exemplary, Hildebrandt and Ulmer used Gradient Boosting Decision Trees in their supervised learning approach to map state features directly to expected arrival times in food delivery. Still, different researchers use different approaches on similar problem settings: In contrast to \cite{Hildebrandt2020_EAT}, \cite{Zhu2020_OFCTE_DL} use deep learning to predict accurate order fulfillment cycle times in a meal delivery environment. Moreover, both propose different data models their solution shall learn upon. This is not an isolated case. As we will show later on, such instances are rather mounting up. 

To yield optimal results, not only the choice of the right data and learning model is crucial, but moreover a suitably chosen parametrization of the learning model as well. The art of optimizing model parameters is a highly active research area as hyperparameter has proven that it can improve the model performance in different environments (\citealt{HPOMotivation}, \citealt{WU201926}).

Drawing the connection to the highly competetive market that online food delivery certainly is, we can conclude that choosing a model that yields the best possible results is a significant competitive advantage for any meal delivery platform. For that reason, we intend to conduct further research in this area.

This paper examines the forecast quality of different offline supervised learning models for arrival time estimation problems in meal delivery and builds up on the works of \cite{Hildebrandt2020_EAT} as we operate on the identical problem setting. To accomplish this task, the algorithms will be trained on historical meal delivery data collected within Iowa City. 

This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we will review and discuss literature that focuses on arrival time estimations done via offline supervised learning methods in chapter \ref{chap:review}. We intentionally exclude real-time supervised learning approaches since they are not within the scope of this work. We will then proceed with the problem formulation in \ref{chap:prob}. There, we will recap the RMDP originally presented in \cite{UlmerRMDP}, and work out the differences to the RMDPEAT presented in \cite{Hildebrandt2020_EAT}. By that, we intend to motivate the integration and use of arrival time estimation in the RMDP. In chapter \ref{chap:method}, we fist present the design of our experimental pipeline consisting of three different experiments:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Analyze the model performance behaviour for subsets of different size in order to capture the sufficient sample size needed to train the respective model.
	\item Conduct hyperparameter optimization to attain the optimal configurations and further analyze in what way the parameters of the model impact the outcome. 
	\item Examine the robustness of the models by training the models with different levels of noise in the data.
\end{enumerate}
Then, we present and explain our data model selection, and work out the supervised learning methods used for arrival time prediction in detail. We will then advance to the computational study in chapter \ref{chap:comp}, where we present and discuss the results of our experiments.
In chapter \ref{chap:conc}, we will draw the conclusions.
