\chapter{Introduction}

Nobody likes waiting - be it when you order your next book on Amazon for class or the pizzas at UberEATS for your birthday. In fact, when doing research on this topic, psychologists found out that increased waiting times generally have a significant negative impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty [1,2]. If we take a glance at the online food delivery market, there are more than 700 million people globally that used food delivery services in 2017 with twice as many users being expected in 2024 [3]. According to forecasts for the same time frame, the userbase of eCommerce platforms in general will grow from 2.480 billion to roughly 4.6 billion users [4]. Thus, waiting becomes a large scaled economic issue. What one might not expect is that the customers’ own perceptions regarding their waiting time negatively affect the perceived service quality stronger than actual waiting times do [5,6]. Given these points, we can conclude that a key challenge lies in the communication of accurate arrival time estimations to the customers. 

Current research tackles this task commonly by means of machine learning techniques. Exemplary, while Hildebrandt and Ulmer used Gradient Boosting Decision Trees in their offline approach to map state features directly to expected arrival times in food delivery [7], Zhu et al. implemented a Multilayer Perceptron to predict accurate Order Fulfillment Cycle Times [8], whereas Ulmer and Thomas used approximation to estimate mean arrival times for values of aggregated states in service routing [9]. Other than Khiari et al. who compared several boosting and linear regression algorithms [10] (without incorporating neural networks in their comparison and spatial features in their underlying model which is what we will do), hardly any kind of machine learning model comparison for arrival time estimation purposes in vehicle routing settings can be found. Therefore, we intend to conduct further research in this area.  

This paper examines the forecast quality and performance of different supervised machine learning (ML) techniques in the context of arrival time estimation problems (ETA). To accomplish this task, the algorithms will be trained on historical meal delivery data collected within Iowa City. 

This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we will review and discuss literature on machine learning in general and its usage in the field of arrival time estimation. We will then proceed with our model, where we describe the ETA problem generally and define the model with respect to the underlying problem of our experimental design. Several steps are taken in the solution approach that follows upon our model definition. In the beginning, we present the used ML techniques and define them generally for the sake of understanding the way each of them functions. Concretely, our dataset will undergo a transformation process with the goal in mind of having a reduced feature space with the most impactful features left in the end. We will then advance to the computational study, where we present its experimental design and discuss its results. Finally, we will create variations of our experimental design in order to analyze each algorithm’s robustness and impact in these different settings.
